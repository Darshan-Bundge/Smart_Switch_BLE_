# Smart Switch (BLE)  
# ESP32-Based Bluetooth Smart Home Switch

This project implements a smart switch using an ESP32 microcontroller and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. It allows users to wirelessly control electrical devices via a smartphone application, making home automation accessible and affordable.



 üîß Features

- Bluetooth Connectivity: Uses BLE for fast and secure communication between ESP32 and smartphone.
- Smartphone App Control: Supports Android/iOS apps for wireless device switching.
- Reliable Performance: Powered by ESP32 for consistent and responsive operation.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for seamless interaction with devices.
- Customizable: Easily adaptable for different use cases, devices, or voice control integration.



 ‚öôÔ∏è Components

- ESP32 Microcontroller: Main control unit for Bluetooth communication and switch logic.
- Relay Module: Controls high-voltage appliances connected to the switch.
- Bluetooth (BLE): Built-in ESP32 Bluetooth for wireless pairing.
- Power Supply: Provides power to the ESP32 and connected modules.
- Smartphone Application: Android/iOS app to control devices remotely.
